poem about mom

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A poem about mom, so tender and true,  
A heart full of love in all that you do.  
Guiding my steps with gentle embrace,  
A warm, steady light in life’s every place.  

Your voice is a comfort, soft and clear,  
A melody whispering, "I’m always near."  
Through trials and laughter, sorrow and song,  
You’ve been my shelter, steadfast and strong.  

In your eyes, I find endless grace,  
A timeless bond no time can erase.  
Thank you, dear Mom, for all that you’ve done—  
A poem of love for you, the only one.
