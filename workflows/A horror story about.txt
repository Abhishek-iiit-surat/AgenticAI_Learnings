A horror story about a nun

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sister Agnes had always been the quietest nun in the convent, her presence barely noticeable except for the faint scent of lilies she carried wherever she went. The villagers whispered that she was touched by something otherworldly, for no matter how harsh the winter or how dark the nights, Agnes never seemed to age.

One stormy evening, as thunder rattled the chapel’s stained glass windows, a desperate knock echoed through the stone halls. The Mother Superior opened the door to find a man, wild-eyed and trembling. "Please," he gasped, "the woods are alive... with shadows that bleed."

The convent doors were barred, prayers whispered fervently, but Sister Agnes seemed oddly calm. She lit a candle and walked toward the chapel’s ancient confessional booth. Inside, her voice was barely a whisper as she spoke to the darkness, "I am ready."

As lightning illuminated her face, the villagers outside saw her eyes flash an unnatural shade of black. The storm ceased abruptly, leaving the night unnervingly silent. The next morning, Sister Agnes was gone, and in her place was a chilling message carved into the wooden cross above the altar: *“The shadows serve now.”*

From that day forward, no one dared enter the convent after dusk. And sometimes, on the fiercest nights, the faint sound of a nun’s hymn drifted from the woods — a hymn twisted by a darkness no prayer could quell.
